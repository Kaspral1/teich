# Teich - Roadmap

## Current Status: Alpha SFT Pipeline

Teich now has a usable trace-first generation and SFT preparation flow:

- Docker-backed Codex, Pi, Claude Code, and Hermes runners with concurrent prompt execution.
- Hermes runs with built-in toolsets including delegation, and exported delegated subagent sessions stay as separate trace files linked by `parent_session_id`.
- Text-only `chat` provider for structured training rows without Docker.
- YAML configuration with provider, model, prompt-file, output, MCP, and publish settings.
- CLI `init` / `generate` commands with resume support and Rich progress reporting.
- Raw trace preservation, partial-output recovery, and deterministic Docker container cleanup.
- Structured conversion to `messages` / `tools` / `metadata` rows.
- Embedded configured tool-schema snapshots in generated dataset READMEs.
- JSONL/NDJSON prompt files as the recommended generation input format.
- Multi-turn `follow_up_prompts` for chat and Docker-backed agent generation.
- `prepare_data()` + `mask_data()` as the supported trainer-first SFT path.
- `load_traces()` for fallback/manual workflows where users own chat-template rendering, filtering, tokenization, and masking.
- Generated dataset README cards that show the current Teich SFT path.

- [x] Verify session files are extracted correctly with real or provider-native sessions
- [x] Verify trace format matches HF expectations on generated trace examples
- [ ] Test MCP server configuration with real servers
- [ ] Validate LM Studio / Ollama local-provider runs through Codex OSS mode

### 1.2 Error Handling

- [x] Handle Docker not installed/running
- [ ] Handle invalid OpenAI API key or unavailable local provider
- [x] Handle network timeouts during agent execution
- [x] Handle session extraction failures
- [x] Preserve partial raw traces on runner failure/interruption
- [x] Clean up orphan-prone Docker containers on failure/interruption
- [ ] Retry logic for failed prompts

### 1.3 Output Format Validation

## Phase 2: Training Data Conversion & SFT Preparation

### 2.1 Public Training Flow

Recommended path:

```python
from teich import mask_data, prepare_data

train_dataset = prepare_data(
    ["username/chat-traces", "username/tool-traces"],
    tokenizer,
    max_length=32768,
    drop_oversized_examples=True,
    chat_template_kwargs={"enable_thinking": True},
)

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model=model,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    args=SFTConfig(
        dataset_text_field="text",
        max_length=32768,
        packing=False,
        output_dir="outputs",
    ),
)
trainer = mask_data(trainer, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

Fallback/manual path:

```python
from teich import load_traces

dataset = load_traces("./output")
example = dataset[0]
rendered = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    example["messages"],
    tools=example.get("tools") or [],
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=False,
)
tokenized = tokenizer(rendered, truncation=True, max_length=32768)
```

### 2.2 Supported Normalized Formats

- [x] **OpenAI-style chat/message format** as the primary normalized training representation.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "...", "reasoning_content": "..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [...]},
    {"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "...", "content": "..."}

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Run small real generation smoke tests** periodically for Codex, Pi, Claude Code, Hermes, and chat with 1-2 prompts each.
2. **Run a small real `prepare_data()` + `mask_data()` smoke test** against the newly generated output and the intended tokenizer.
3. **Audit generated examples manually** for tool-call rendering, reasoning supervision, follow-up turns, and empty/error sessions.
4. **Decide quality-filter policy** for failed sessions and low-value traces.
5. **Add docs/tutorials** around creating, publishing, loading, and training on a first dataset.

## Open Questions

1. Which Codex CLI versions should Teich explicitly support for non-interactive runs?
2. Should LM Studio and Ollama stay routed through Codex OSS mode, or get their own non-Codex runner?
3. What quality metrics should Teich filter on before training?
4. Should Teich eventually offer optional model/template presets, or keep explicit `chat_template_kwargs` only?
5. Should Claude Code's OpenRouter surrogate model be configurable, or stay fixed to a known Claude allowlist value?
6. How should Parquet and train/validation split generation fit into the trace-first workflow?
